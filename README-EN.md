Hello. As of 2025, I am an iOS developer with 15 years of experience.<br>
I have diverse experiences including transitioning from Objective-C to Swift, introducing RxSwift and MVVM architecture, and building modular architecture using Tuist.<br>

I have strengths in development based on Objective-C and Swift, and have experience in app development using RxSwift and MVVM patterns.<br>
In addition, I have been working on projects using the latest technologies such as FlexLayout, PinLayout, SwiftUI, Clean Architecture, Coordinator(RxFlow), Composable Architecture, Tuist, and Modular Architecture.

I consider work efficiency and app quality improvement through collaboration and communication to be important.<br>
While collaborating with team members from various roles such as Android developers, designers, and planners, I realized that there is a lot to learn from each other, and through this, I am creating better products.

I am actively learning new programming languages, patterns, and tools, and consider growing together with colleagues important.<br>
To this end, I actively participate in study groups and am familiar with the culture of improving product quality through code reviews and continuous communication.<br>
This approach is also reflected in open source activities, and I am continuously developing through various projects.
